This website is the official documentation of the **Web Task Dashboard** plugin for Obsidian.
The source code and issues can be found [in GitHub](https://github.com/mbedded/obsidian-web-task-dashboard).

## About this plugin

The plugin integrates tasks from various third-party web services into Obsidian.
This allows users to manage their tasks within a single application, eliminating context switching.
Users can stay in their familiar environment while accessing and organizing tasks.
By keeping everything in one place, the plugin enhances productivity and streamlines workflow.

Please note, that the first version supports only [Tracks]({% link docs/Configuration/Tracks.md %}) as a backend.
New endpoints may be introduced in the future.
