# Contributing

Thank you for your contribution!
This guide helps you to get an overview of the contribution process
and how to contribute to this project.

## Check before doing anything

Is there already an issue or Pull-Request (PR) existing?
Maybe the issue is fixed but not merged (and published) yet.
If you think that some details are missing, please comment on the issue or the PR. 
If it's missing: Create an issue and describe the fix or feature.

We want to avoid duplicates and keep the issues as clean as possible.

> [!NOTE]
> Minor issues and trivial fixes like typos or missing language translations
> can be pushed directly via a PR without creating an issue first.
